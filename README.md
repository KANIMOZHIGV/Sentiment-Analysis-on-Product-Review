# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Product-Review
## Performed Sentiment Analysis on Amazon product dataset.
## In this project, we will predict empty values in the database using existing product reviews. Data mining techniques such as the Naive bayes classifier, LogisticRegression and the Random Forest are used.
## Initially, test data is collected on the e-commerce website Amazon.com. Each set of data is in a comma-separated file format (CSV).
## In the second step, the data is processed in advance to extract stop words, punctuation marks, white spaces, digits and special symbols. 
## In the third step, the feature selection is performed to extract the relevant features from the data set. For the data provided set in six categories, only three features, namely, Product Name, Product Name and Assigned Reviews.
## In the fourth step, the emotional direction in the reviews is determined and ‘Good / Bad’ tags are added to the database to accompany each update to further monitor reading.
## The sixth step involves training and evaluating classified data using models from Naive Bayes, SVM and Random Forest.
